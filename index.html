<h3>About</h3>
<p>
I am an Associate Professor in the State Key Lab of Processors 
(previously known as the State Key Lab of Computer Architecture), 
at the <a href="http://english.ict.cas.cn/">
	Institute of Computing Technology (ICT), CAS</a>.
I received a PhD in Computer Science and Engineering 
from the <a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au/engineering/our-schools/computer-science-and-engineering">University of New South Wales (UNSW)</a> in 2014, 
under the supervision of 
<a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/about/our-people/academic-staff/sri-parameswaran.html">
	Prof. Sri Parameswaran</a>. 
Before joining ICT CAS, I was affiliated to 
<a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au/engineering/our-schools/computer-science-and-engineering"> UNSW CSE </a>  
and 
<a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au/research/ifcyber"> UNSW IFCYBER </a>(Research Fellow), 
where I worked as the Tech Lead and Secondary Investigator on 
two trustworthy computer architecture projects, with DSTG Australia.
<br>

<strong>We are hiring!</strong> 
We are looking for postdoc, junior or early-stage researcher to join our team.
If you are interested in processor security research and want to work with us,
please contact. 
We also have internship and exchange positions open for postgraduate students.

<h3>Research</h3>
<p>
My main research areas are computer architecture, computer security, 
and fault tolerance. 
My current research focus is innovating and building RISC-V platform for trustworthy and resilient computing.  
We mainly work on XiangShan RISC-V processors.
<br>
<br>
My previous research works are summarized as follows.
<br>
<ul>
 <li>
<strong>RISC-V ISA for memory safety:</strong> 
Memory safety is a notorious issue for C/C++ programming language, which lack the automatic memory management mechanisms. 
In recent years, statistics (see <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2019/07/we-need-a-safer-systems-programming-language/">Microsoft's</a>) from industry have shown that memory safety issues are key factors that threaten the system security. 
Based on the seminal work of <a href="https://llvm.org/pubs/2009-06-PLDI-SoftBound.html">SoftBound</a>
and <a href="https://intel-mpx.github.io/index.html">lessons learnt from Intel MPX extension</a>,
we created RISC-V-based architectural solution, documented in <a href="https://li3tuo4.github.io/pub/dow-dac.pdf">[DAC2021]</a> 
and <a href="https://li3tuo4.github.io/pub/dow-dac22.pdf">[DAC2022a]</a> 
for adding pointer-based memory safety architectural support into RISC-V ISA, 
which uses disjoint metadata structure (non-fat-pointer). 
The extended instruction set supports both spatial (out-of-bound errors) and 
temporal (use-after-free errors) memory safety corruptions, 
with moderate hardware overhead, while making significant improvement on the memory safety protection cost, 
in comparison to software-based approaches such as 
<a href="https://llvm.org/pubs/2009-06-PLDI-SoftBound.html">SoftBound</a> 
and <a href="https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer">AddressSanitizer</a>. 
This genre of approach, in comparison to Cambridge University's 
<a href=""https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/>CHERI research</a>, 
retrofits existing C/C++ codebase without rewriting the target software codebase 
and does not incur drastic hardware modifications, such as on-chip bus extension.
 </li> 
 <br>
 <li>
<strong>Architectural support for microarchitectural timing channel mitigation:</strong>
microarchitectural timing attacks, such as 
<a href="https://meltdownattack.com/">Meltdown and Spectre</a>, 
have been identified as one of the major computer architecture challenges
(see <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/research/a-new-golden-age-for-computer-architecture/">Hennessy and Patterson's Turing Lecture</a>). 
Our reseach (see <a href="">[DAC2022b]</a> and <a href="">[ArXiv2020]</a>)
created new ISA extension with micro-architectural enhancement, 
demonstrated on RISC-V rocket chip, which enables system to enforce strict timing channel isolation in between security domains. 
This genre of work supports "time protection" (see <a href="https://trustworthy.systems/publications/abstracts/Ge_YCH_19.abstract">seL4's definition</a> ) at operating system layer. 
Similar ISA extension (<span style="font-family:'Courier New'">fence.t</span>) has been adopted in <a href="https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-security-model">the RISC-V security model specification</a>. 
 </li>

 <strong>Dependable embedded processor:</strong>
Soft errors (early observed in space <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4328188">in electronic equipment</a>, 
and, at ground level, recored in <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5658018">the Cray-1 computers at Los Alamos</a>) are essentially transient failures that do not permanently damage the processor and do not recur.
Historically, soft errors have been primarily concerned with the design of high availability systems 
or systems that are deployed in environments that are hostile to electronics, such as outer space. 
As devices scale, the soft error rate for each individual device due to radiation is projected to 
remain approximately constant or expected to decrease. However, the exponential increase in the
integration of the chip leads to correspondingly dramatic decreases in reliability 
(see <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5784522">research by Oracle</a>). 
As a result, it was a consensus between industry and academia that system architecture 
must be reviewed for such a challenge (see <a href="https://vlsicad.ucsd.edu/Publications/Conferences/302/c302.pdf">the 2011 report from the ITRS</a> and <a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~shubu/papers/serproblem-hpca2005.pdf">the perspective given by Intel and University of Michigan</a>). 
Our goal is to find efficient architectural solutions for embedded processors (for instance Leon2 processor with SPARC ISA)
to be soft-error-resilient, given that soft errors are inevitable. 
Our research (see <a href="https://li3tuo4.github.io/pub/li-tc.pdf">[IEEE-TC2017]</a>,
<a href="https://li3tuo4.github.io/pub/date16.pdf">[DATE2016]</a>) 
is a collaboration with <a href="https://ces.itec.kit.edu/">CES KIT</a>
under DFG Priority Program <a href="https://spp1500.itec.kit.edu/">SPP-1500</a>.
