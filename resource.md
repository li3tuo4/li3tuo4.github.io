From this perspective, the question is closer to "What utility does C++ and LLVM provide over manually written assembly language?"

Also, a great story [beating the averages](http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html) is shared by Paul Graham about their use of Lisp in their successful start-up adventure:

The safest kind were the ones that wanted Oracle experience. You never had to worry about those. You were also safe if they said they wanted C++ or Java developers. If they wanted Perl or Python programmers, that would be a bit frightening-- that's starting to sound like a company where the technical side, at least, is run by real hackers. If I had ever seen a job posting looking for Lisp hackers, I would have been really worried.
