abstract = {Memory safety is paramount for secure systems. Pointer-based memory safety relies on additional information (metadata) to check validity when a pointer is dereferenced. Such operations on the metadata introduce significant performance overhead to the system. This paper presents HWST128, a system to reduce performance overhead by using hardware/software co-design. As a result, the system described achieves spatial and temporal safety by utilizing microarchitecture support, pointer analysis from the compiler, and metadata compression. HWST128 is the first complete solution for memory safety (spatial and temporal) on RISC-V. The system is implemented and tested on a Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA board with 1536 LUTs (+4.11%) and 112 FFs (+0.66%) on top of a Rocket Chip processor. HWST128 is 3.74\texttimes{} faster than the equivalent software-based safety system in the SPEC2006 benchmark suite while providing similar or better security coverage for the Juliet test suite.},
